# CoJ2 Custom Maps

This is a compilation of all custom maps that I have been able to find.
The Maps for CoJ2 can be put into 3 categories.
1. Base Game (8)
- There are maps in the base game. Not in the repo, but important to note.
2. Old West DLC (4)
- I have a set of files for the Old West DLC from both the 360 and PS3 versions that I am attempting to make work on PC.
3. Custom Maps (32)
 - This is a set of 32 maps that I was able to find over the course of 2020-2022, more will be added to that as I find them.
 - A notable addition to this list is the Heaven Mod Pack. 22 maps built for v1.0 that I updated to v1.1 and play nicely with previously found custom maps.

## Custom Map Limitations
For ease of install, custom maps should use _MP_MAP_CUSTOM0 through _MP_MAP_CUSTOM29 for the MapId in the map's .trk file. Reusing a MapId only causes issues when a server/lobby tries to load a MapId that has already been used.

## How to Install Custom Maps

A functional copy of all custom maps can also be
found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HkWfwv-7gAKSQzIHQFQ3hJN3iJkNIVp/view?usp=sharing).

1. Find .../Documents/Call of Juarez - Bound in Blood/data
2. Copy characters, creatures, and mapsnet into the above folder
3. Make sure you have data/characters, data/creatures, and data/mapsnet in .../Documents/Call of Juarez - Bound in
   Blood/

I am not totally sure which maps require what files out of characters and creatures, so make sure they are there regardless of what maps you load from mapsnet.

Maps pancho and pancho2 are duplicates. Whichever map you choose to add should be in a folder named "pancho"

Maps last_bullet_rebirth and last_bullet_rebirth2 are duplicates. Whichever map you choose to add should be in a folder named "last_bullet_rebirth"
