# CoJ2 Custom Maps

## How to Install Custom Maps

A functional copy of all custom maps can also be
found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HkWfwv-7gAKSQzIHQFQ3hJN3iJkNIVp/view?usp=sharing).

1. Find .../Documents/Call of Juarez - Bound in Blood/data
2. Copy characters, creatures, and mapsnet into the above folder
3. Make sure you have data/characters, data/creatures, and data/mapsnet in .../Documents/Call of Juarez - Bound in
   Blood/

I am not totally sure which maps require what files out of characters and creatures, so make sure they are there regardless of what maps you load from mapsnet.
